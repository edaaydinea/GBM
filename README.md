# Gradient Boosting Machine Algorithm 

We did this project as a group while I participating in Applied Machine Learning and Numerical Software Development courses through  Organon Analytics.

Gradient Boosting is another technique for performing supervised machine learning tasks, like classification and regression. XGBoost is particularly popular because it has been the winning algorithm in a number of recent Kaggle competitions.
